## Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in Java

This repository contains my solutions to the  [Advent of Code 2024](http://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles with
the Java programming language.

I developed the solutions partly by myself and partly with the help of GitHub Copilot.
I used the puzzles to test Copilot and to see how well it can help me solve the puzzles.

The solutions where I used Copilot are annotated with comments. Through these comments,
I tried to document my experiences with Copilot a little.

I also recorded special features of the solution finding process for the respective puzzles in code comments.
