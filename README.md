## Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in Java

This repository contains my solutions to the  [Advent of Code 2024](http://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles with
the Java programming language.

I developed the solutions partly by myself and partly with the help of GitHub Copilot.
I used the puzzles to test Copilot and to see how well it can help me solve the puzzles.

The solutions where I used Copilot are annotated with comments. Through these comments,
I tried to document my experiences with Copilot a little.

I also recorded special features of the solution finding process for the respective puzzles in code comments.

The puzzle inputs can be found under [`src/main/resources`](https://github.com/ozoeller/Advent-of-Code-2024-Java/tree/main/src/main/resources/dev/zoeller/aoc2024).
Please note that each participant receives unique inputs.
In the classes containing my solutions ([`src/main/java`](https://github.com/ozoeller/Advent-of-Code-2024-Java/tree/main/src/main/java/dev/zoeller/aoc2024)),
comments are included at the points where the solution is output,
indicating the solution value for my puzzle input. The solution value will vary for different puzzle inputs.
